This project should run on Win32 with Visual C++ and g++ for Linux.
Other flavors of systems should work as well, but need some tweaks
in the Makefile.

[ Win32 ]

You should have Visual C++ 2002 or better installed and have run
vcvars32.bat to set the environments required to run command-line
VC compiler "cl.exe".

To build everything:

   nmake -f NMakefile

To run the little test suite:

   nmake -f NMakefile test

The expected testing output is similar to the output of the Linux
version given below.

[ Linux ]

To build everything:

    make

To run the little test suite:

    make test

The "appear" program is for 15-char sequences, "appear2" for 2-char
sequences, and "appear1" for 1-char sequences.

The expected testing output is like:

    ./appears
    No input file specified.
    make: [test] Error 1 (ignored)
    ===========================
    ./appears no-such-file
    ERROR: Failed to open input file no-such-file for reading: No such file or directory
    make: [test] Error 1 (ignored)
    ===========================
    ./appears samples/invalid.txt
    ERROR: File samples/invalid.txt: line 2: Invalid character found: 'D' (0x44)
    make: [test] Error 1 (ignored)
